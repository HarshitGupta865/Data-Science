Functions in python are of following types:

1. Built-in functions
2. User defined functions
3. Recursive functions
4. Lambda functions
5. Extra - map(), reduce(), filter()

--------> Lambda functions are anonymous functions. It can have multiple arguments and only has a one line expression.

--------> map() is one of the most important function in python and is used to reduce line of codes.
	Syntax:    map(function, iterable). Function is the type of function you want to use with any iterable. If the function require
	N nos. of iterables then use N nos. of iterables with the function. Example if a function requires 3 iterables then the syntax becomes
	map(function, iterable1, iterable2, iterable3)

--------> filter(): Syntax --  filter(function, iterable). Here function should always return a boolean value. If the result of function is true only then
	process takes place for that value of iterable. Moreover filter can only be used with those functions that can take only one iterable.

-------> reduce() - Syntax -- reduce(function, iterable). reduce() is used to fold or reduce an iterable to a value.
