Bias refers to the errors that occur when a model is too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the underlying data.
This can result in the model making incorrect assumptions and consistently producing inaccurate predictions.

Variance refers to the errors that occur when a model is too complex and overfits the training data, meaning it is too specific
to the training data and cannot generalize well to new data. This can result in the model being overly sensitive to noise in the training 
data and producing inconsistent or unreliable predictions.

The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between these two types of errors. Ideally, we want a model that has low bias and low variance,
meaning it is both accurate and generalizable. However, in practice, it can be difficult to achieve this balance, and adjustments may need 
to be made to reduce one type of error at the expense of the other.

In other words, the bias-variance tradeoff refers to the compromise that must be made between the complexity of a model and its ability 
to accurately generalize to new data.
