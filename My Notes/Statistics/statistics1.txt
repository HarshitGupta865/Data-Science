Statistics is the science of collecting, organising and analysing data. It helps to make better decisions from the data we have.

Data can be anything. It can be numbers, images, audio, words etc.

Where do we get data from:
----------------------------------

This can be answered in two ways. 1. Organic/Process Data - Data that is formed naturally as a result of some process. Such processes generate
massive amount of data often termed as big data.
2. Designed data collection - Such data is designed to specifically answer some stated research objective. Such data is not huge and is restricted
to the domain of its origin.

Types of variable
-----------------------

1. Quantitative variable - Variables that represent amount or numbers and have ability to have any arithmetic operations performed on them.
Two types - Quantitative continuous variable and quantitative discrete variable.

2. Qualitative variable - Variables that often represent items / individuals into groups. It also has two types - qualitative ordinal variable and 
qualitative nominal variable.
