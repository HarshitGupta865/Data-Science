Steps to be carried out for exploratory data analysis on a dataset

-----------------------------------------
Step - 1: Data Oerview
-------------------------------------

1. Have a clear understanding of problem statement
2. Understand the dataset well. Be aware of every columns in the dataset

---------------------------------------------
Step - 2: Data Wrangling
-------------------------------------

1. Check for missing values. If any either drop it or replace it.
2. Check for the correct data format of each columns that will help to do a better data analysis.
3. Standardize and normalize data if needed.
4. Perform binning if required. It is the process of converting numerical data into categorical data
5. Indicator variables are used to analyse categorical data by converting it into numerical data

Step - 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
----------------------------------------------

1. When visualizing individual variables, it is important to first understand what type of variable
 you are dealing with. This will help us find the right visualization method for that variable.
2. A great way of visualising continous numerical variable is by using scatterplot with fitted lines.
3. Categorical variables are variables that describe a 'characteristic' of a data unit, and are selected from a small group of categories.
A good way to visualize categorical variables is by using boxplots.
4. Find correlation and causation between variables
